# Plugins<a name="rabbitmq-basic-elements-plugins"></a>

Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ supports the [RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) which powers the management API and the RabbitMQ web console\. You can use the web console and the management API to create and manage broker users and policies\.

In addition to the management plugin, Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ also supports the following plugins\.

**Topics**
+ [Shovel plugin](#rabbitmq-shovel-plugin)
+ [Federation plugin](#rabbitmq-federation-plugin)
+ [Consistent Hash exchange plugin](#rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange)

## Shovel plugin<a name="rabbitmq-shovel-plugin"></a>

Amazon MQ managed brokers support [RabbitMQ shovel](https://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html), allowing you to move messages from queues and exchanges on one broker instance to another\. You can use shovel to connect loosely coupled brokers and distribute messages away from nodes with heavier message loads\.

Amazon MQ managed RabbitMQ brokers support dynamic shovels\. Dynamic shovels are configured using runtime parameters, and can be started and stopped at any time programatically by a client connection\. For example, using the RabbitMQ management API, you can create a `PUT` request to the following API endpoint to configure a dynamic shovel\. In the example, `{vhost}` can be replaced by the name of the broker's vhost, and `{name}` replaced by the name of the new dynamic shovel\.

```
/api/parameters/shovel/{vhost}/{name}
```

In the request body, you must specify either a queue or an exchange but not both\. This example below configures a dynamic shovel between a local queue specified in `src-queue` and a remote queue defined in `dest-queue`\. Similairly, you can use `src-exchange` and `dest-exchange` parameters to configure a shovel between two exchanges\.

```
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri":  "amqp://localhost",
    "src-queue":  "source-queue-name",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqps://b-c8352341-ec91-4a78-ad9c-a43f23d325bb.mq.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:5671",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue-name"
  }
}
```
When creating a dynamic shovel that uses an Amazon MQ managed exhange as a source, make sure to specify `amqps://` in `src-uri` as only port `5671` is available for communication\.

```
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri":  "amqps://localhost",
    "src-queue":  "source-queue-name",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqp:///b-c8352341-ec91-4a78-ad9c-a43f23d325bb.mq.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:5671",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue-name"
  }
}
```

**Important**  
You cannot configure shovel between queues or exchanges if the shovel destination is a private broker\. You can only configure shovel between queues or exchanges in public brokers, or between a source in a private broker, and a destination in a public broker\.

For more information about using dynamic shovels, see [RabbitMQ dynamic shovel plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel-dynamic.html)\.

**Note**  
Amazon MQ does not support using static shovels\.

## Federation plugin<a name="rabbitmq-federation-plugin"></a>

 Amazon MQ supports federated exchanges and queues\. With federation, you can replicate the flow of messages between queues, exchanges and consumers on separate brokers\. Federated queues and exchanges use point\-to\-point links to connect to peers in other brokers\. While federated exchanges, by default, route messages once, federated queues can move messages any number of times as needed by consumers\.

You can use federation to allow a *downstream* broker to consume a message from an exchange or a queue on an *upstream*\. You can enable federation on downstream brokers by using the RabbitMQ web console or the management API\.

**Important**  
You cannot configure federation if the downstream queue or exchange is in a private broker\. You can only configure federation between queues or exchanges in public brokers, or between an upstream queue or exchange in a private broker, and a downstream queue or exchange in a public broker\.

For example, using the management API, you can configure federation by doing the following\.
+ Configure one or more upstreams that define federation connections to other nodes\. You can define federation connections by using the RabbitMQ web console or the management API\. Using the management API, you can create a `POST` request to `/api/parameters/federation-upstream/%2f/my-upstream` with the following request body\.

  ```
  {"value":{"uri":"amqp://server-name","expires":3600000}}
  ```
+ Configure a policy to enable your queues or exchanges to become federated\. You can configure policies by using the RabbitMQ web console, or the management API\. Using the management API, you can create a `POST` request to `/api/policies/%2f/federate-me` with the following request body\.

  ```
  {"pattern":"^amq\.", "definition":{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}, "apply-to":"exchanges"}
  ```
**Note**  
The request body assumes exchanges on the server are named beginning with `amq`\. Using regular expression `^amq\.` will ensure that federation is enabled for all exchanges whose names begin with "amq\." The exchanges on your RabbitMQ server can be named differently\.

For more information about configuring the federation plugin, see [RabbitMQ federation plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html)\.

## Consistent Hash exchange plugin<a name="rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange"></a>

 By default, Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ supports the Consistent Hash exchange type plugin\. Consistent Hash exchanges route messages to queues based on a hash value calculated from the *routing key* of a message\. Given a reasonably even routing key, Consistent Hash exchanges can distribute messages between queues reasonably evenly\. 

 For queues bound to a Consistent Hash exchange, the binding key is a number\-as\-a\-string that determines the *binding weight* of each queue\. Queues with a higher binding weight will receive a proportionally higher distribution of messages from the Consistent Hash exchange to which they are bound\. In a Consistent Hash exchange topology, publishers can simply publish messages to the exchange, but consumers must be explicitly configured to consume messages from specific queues\. 

 For more information about Consistent Hash exchanges, see [RabbitMQ Consistent Hash Exchange Type](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/master/deps/rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange) on the GitHub website\.
