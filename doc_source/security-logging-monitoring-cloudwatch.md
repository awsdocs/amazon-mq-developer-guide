# Monitoring Amazon MQ brokers using Amazon CloudWatch<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon MQ and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so you can use CloudWatch to view and analyze metrics for your ActiveMQ broker and the broker's destinations \(queues and topics\)\. You can view and analyze your Amazon MQ metrics from the CloudWatch console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudWatch CLI\. CloudWatch metrics for Amazon MQ are automatically polled from the broker and then pushed to CloudWatch every minute\.

For information, see [Accessing CloudWatch metrics for Amazon MQ](amazon-mq-accessing-metrics.md)\.

**Note**  
The following statistics are valid for all of the metrics:  
`Average`
`Minimum`
`Maximum`
`Sum`

The `AWS/AmazonMQ` namespace includes the following metrics\.

| BurstBalance | Percent | The percentage of burst credits remaining on the Amazon EBS volume used to persist message data for throughput\-optimized brokers\. If this balance reaches zero, the IOPS provided by the Amazon EBS volume will decrease until the Burst Balance refills\. For more information on how Burst Balances work in Amazon EBS, see: [I/O Credits and Burst Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#IOcredit)\. |

The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started \(including the number of launch credits\)\. The credit balance is available for the broker instance to spend on bursts beyond the baseline CPU utilization\.

#### Dimensions for ActiveMQ broker metrics<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-dimensions"></a>


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Broker |  The name of the broker A single\-instance broker has the suffix \-1\. An active/standby broker for high availability has the suffixes \-1 and \-2 for its redundant pair\.  | 

### ActiveMQ destination \(queue and topic\) metrics<a name="security-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch-destination-metrics"></a>

**Important**  
The following metrics include per\-minute counts for the CloudWatch polling period\.  
`EnqueueCount`
`ExpiredCount`
`DequeueCount`
`DispatchCount`
`InFlightCount`
For example, in a five\-minute [CloudWatch period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#CloudWatchPeriods), `EnqueueCount` has five count values, each for a one\-minute portion of the period\. The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics provide the lowest and highest per\-minute value during the specified period\.


| Metric | Unit | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ConsumerCount | Count | The number of consumers subscribed to the destination\. | 
| EnqueueCount | Count | The number of messages sent to the destination, per minute\. | 
| EnqueueTime | Time \(milliseconds\) | The end\-to\-end latency from when a message arrives at a broker until it is delivered to a consumer\. `EnqueueTime` does not measure the end\-to\-end latency from when a message is sent by a producer until it reaches the broker, nor the latency from when a message is received by a broker until it is acknowledged by the broker\. Rather, `EnqueueTime` is the number of milliseconds from the moment a message is received by the broker until it is successfully delivered to a consumer\.   | 
| ExpiredCount | Count | The number of messages that couldn't be delivered because they expired, per minute\. | 
| DispatchCount | Count | The number of messages sent to consumers, per minute\. | 
| DequeueCount | Count | The number of messages acknowledged by consumers, per minute\. | 
| InFlightCount | Count | The number of messages sent to consumers that have not been acknowledged\. | 
| ReceiveCount | Count | The number of messages that have been received from the remote broker for a duplex network connector\. | 
| MemoryUsage | Percent | The percentage of the memory limit that the destination currently uses\. | 
| ProducerCount | Count | The number of producers for the destination\. | 
| QueueSize | Count | The number of messages in the queue\. This metric applies only to queues\.  | 
| TotalEnqueueCount | Count | The total number of messages that have been sent to the broker\. | 
| TotalDequeueCount | Count | The total number of messages that have been consumed by clients\. | 

**Note**  
`TotalEnqueueCount` and `TotalDequeueCount` metrics include messages for advisory topics\. For more information about advisory topic messages, see the [ActiveMQ documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/advisory-message.html)\.
